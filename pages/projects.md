# Open project database

We want to make finding projects easier for students and advertising projects easier for scientists
with research opportunities. Today, this is very much a work in progress... eventually you will be able
to search for perspective project ideas and easily add new project opportunities to this repository.

This page is a prototype project database. Use the menu bars to select projects based on their attributes. Projects with no value
specified for a given attribute will not be included if a selection is made on that attribute. Projects may instead specify
that they are appropriate for multiple options (or any option) for a given attribute.
Click the triangle next to each project for more information (if provided by the project mentors).

{% include project_database.md %}
