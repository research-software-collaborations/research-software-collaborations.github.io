project_title: Sustainable Quantum Algorithms for Particle Track Reconstruction
project_goal: > This project explores quantum approaches to the computationally intensive task of particle track reconstruction at high-luminosity colliders. By reformulating hit association and track finding as graph optimisation and pattern-recognition tasks, we will investigate QAOA and quantum machine-learning methods (e.g., variational classifiers) tailored to NISQ hardware, and implement prototypes in Qiskit/PennyLane. A second thrust will develop quantum-assisted optimisation for automatic tuning of track-reconstruction parameters within the ACTS framework, benchmarking quantum-inspired tuners against classical baselines (efficiency, resolution, runtime). Deliverables include a Python prototype, comparative performance reports, open-source code and documentation, and a final project report.
