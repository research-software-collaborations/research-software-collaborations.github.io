project_title: Adopting CppInterOp in Cppyy
project_goal: >
  cppyy is a Python library that provides fully automatic, dynamic Python-C++ bindings using the
  cling based C++ interpreter/incremental compiler. Cling itself is based on the LLVM toolchain.
  Compiler Research maintains its own fork of cppyy. The main motivation of this fork is to directly
  use the LLVM’s clang-REPL as C/C++ interpreter/incremental compiler and runtime reflection
  library. This reduces the burden on the developers to maintain a separate fork of LLVM like the
  cling interpreter. The main goal of this project is to complete this migration from using cling
  as the interpreter backend to using clang-REPL through CppInterOp. CppInterOp is developed and
  maintained by compiler research. It is a high level abstraction of the underlying LLVM API.
  CppInterOp is designed to be simple and minimalistic. It is built for the
  purpose of language interoperability, incremental C++ compilation, and runtime C++ reflection.
