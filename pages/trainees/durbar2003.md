project_title: Enabling Advanced Network and Infrastructure Alarms
project_goal: >
  We aspire to improve and maximize the diagnostic range and capability of the alarms to effectively identify the various problems one might face before they are actually encountered by scientists performing experiments that involve these networks or impact the network measurement infrastructure’s ability to gather data.  Ultimately, we aim to create an improved alerting and alarming system related to both the research and education networks used by HEP, WLCG and OSG communities.
