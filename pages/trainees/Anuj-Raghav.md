project_title: "H → WW NanoAOD Analysis Framework: A Guide to LHC Data Analysis"
project_goal: >
  This project will create an easy-to-follow, reproducible analysis framework for studying the Higgs boson decay to WW (H → WW) using NanoAOD data from the LHC. It’s designed to help beginners and early-career researchers learn realistic collider data analysis step-by-step. The work will include well-documented Python notebooks, along with clear explanations, so users can carry out event selection, background estimation, and result visualization while understanding the physics behind each step. The final outcome will be a public GitHub repository that works both as a practical analysis toolkit and a comprehensive learning resource.
