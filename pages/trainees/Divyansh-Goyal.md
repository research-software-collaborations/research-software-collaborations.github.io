project_title: Julia Interfaces to HepMC3 Event Record Library
project_goal: >
  High Energy Physics (HEP) fundamentally relies on event record formats like HepMC3
  for simulations and experimental data. This project proposes to develop and establish
  HepMC3.jl, a native Julia interface for this crucial format, with the following key objectives:
  (1) To implement robust reading of HepMC3 event files, with an initial focus on the ASCII format,
  providing access to event data structures, particle properties, and run information.
  (2) To enable full navigation of the event record, including traversal between parent and child
  particles via vertices. (3) To support the creation of new HepMC3 events and the modification of
  existing data structures, along with their re-serialisation back to file (initially ASCII, with
  a stretch goal for ROOT format).
  (4) To ensure comprehensive documentation, illustrative examples, and registration of HepMC3.jl
  in the Julia General Registry for broad accessibility within the JuliaHEP ecosystem.
