<h4>Research Software Collaborations in Physics</h4>
-->

{% capture irishead %}
HSF-India is a US National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project
that began on October 1, 2022. HSF-India aims to join collaborative
networks in India to networks in the U.S. and Europe in order to
build the international research software collaborations required
to reach the science goals of next-generation particle, nuclear
and astroparticle physics experiments including the high-luminosity
Large Hadron Collider at CERN, the Deep Underground Neutrino
Experiment at Fermilab, and the Electron Ion Collider at Brookhaven
National Laboratory. To fully realize their discovery potential
a new generation of software algorithms and approaches is required.
Building these research software collaborations is challenging and
inherently international matching the international nature of the
experimental undertakings themselves. HSF-India will provide students,
postdocs and early career personnel significant experience in
international team science through engagement in a diverse 
research community.

The HSF-India network of networks aims to extend the growing research
software collaborations between physics and computer science researchers 
in the U.S. and Europe to include researchers in India.  By exploiting
national capabilities and strengths, an immediate mutual benefit
of the international collaboration will be a training network that
enables early-career researchers to pursue impactful research
software initiatives in ways that advance their careers in experimental
data-intensive science. HSF-India will build international collaborative
structures which will enable innovation in critical software areas for 
discovery in particle, nuclear and astroparticle physics and lay the 
foundations for similar international collaborations across the scientific 
spectrum.

It is intended to be a long-term investment in team science in physics.
