## Researcher exchanges

The HSF-India project aims to promote the
development of international research software collaborations in physics
by providing opportunities for early career researchers (postdocs, young faculty/staff, senior PhD students)
to establish an extended research exchange (e.g., 1-3 months) to work with other experts in
particle physics, nuclear physics and astroparticle physics,
as well as from the computational and data Science communitues. These research exchanges aim
to achieve specific software deliverables and foster a longer term research collaboration. Our team
has experienced first hand how these short changes can impact research outcomes and careers long term.

### Eligibility
The following exchanges are eligible:
  * A researcher based in India (e.g., employed by an institution in India) to work for 1-3 months with a US-based researcher (including researchers at CERN affiliated with a US institution)
  * A researcher affiliated with a US institution to work for 1-3 months with an India-based researcher

### Support offered for accepted applications
  * Up to three months reasonable support for local costs. These will vary depending on location. Please estimate the needs for your project in application. Talk to us for guidance in case of doubt.
  * Transportation to/from research exchange location
  * Travel support for mentor reverse visit at end of research exchange period

### Timeline
  * We review applications quarterly (January 1, April 1, July 1, October 1) and are receptive to applications at any time.
  * In most cases both the required visa arrangement and housing take time to arrange. Please allow for at least one month of review/approval time in addition to the time needed for these arrangements. We can help you and your host with any accumulated knowledge we have on logistics from our personal experience as well as other exchanges.

### Application process and format
  * Final applications are a joint proposal from both involved researchers and should be supported by both research groups. In case you are interested but do not already have an exchange idea to propose, we are able to assist you in identifying potential opportunities that match your interests and have examples of interested host researchers. In this case, start by expressing your interest in the program and we can work with you from there.
  * Needed components
    * Brief CV of each researcher
    * Project statement including high-level science goals and need (approximately 1 page)
    * Summary of local support infrastructure for visiting researcher
    * Estimated budget need, any timing constraints, etc

### Acceptance criteria
  * Alignment with HSF-India science goals
  * Prospects for longer-term collaboration enabled by research exchange
  * Research software developed as part of the research exchange
